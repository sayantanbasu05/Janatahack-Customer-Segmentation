# Janatahack-Customer-Segmentation
AV organised weekend hackathon on customer segmentation.

Team: Last but not the least

Public Leaderboard : 5

Train.csv and Test.csv are the original files provided in the competition.
I combined the above files and sorted them based on ID to create a new file( say Combined.csv).
Using this file I filled all the missing values in Combined.csv using ffil() and then separated the train and test files back as New_train.csv and New_test.csv
New_train.csv and New_test.csv are modified versions with all missing values filled based on previous rows in the combined sorted Train.csv and Test.csv file.
